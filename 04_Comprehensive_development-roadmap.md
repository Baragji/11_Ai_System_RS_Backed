## Execution Strategy

### For Each Phase:
1. **Single Copilot Task**: Give Copilot one specific task at a time
2. **Test Before Proceeding**: Ensure each phase works before moving to next
3. **Incremental Building**: Each phase builds on previous working foundation
4. **Documentation**: Document any manual fixes needed for future reference

### Sample Copilot Command Format:
```
"Based on the current codebase, implement [specific feature from phase]. 
Requirements: [list specific requirements]
Success criteria: [define what working looks like]
Please create/modify files and open a PR with the implementation."
```

### Critical Success Factors:
- ✅ **Never skip phases** - each builds on the previous
- ✅ **Test thoroughly** - broken foundation breaks everything after
- ✅ **Keep tasks specific** - vague requests lead to incomplete implementations
- ✅ **Manual verification** - always test what Copilot builds
- ✅ **Document issues** - track what Copilot struggles with for future phases

This roadmap transforms your ambitious spec.md into actionable, sequential development phases that Copilot Agent can successfully execute.
