```
- **Zero trust**: mTLS everywhere, policy decision point (OPA) in gateway.
- **Deterministic workflows**: Event-sourced orchestration with idempotent steps and saga-based compensation.
- **Security by default**: OWASP ASVS v5 & LLM Top 10 controls embedded at phase start, not retrofitted.

## Phase 0 – Foundation & Approval (see `01_First_step_approval_needed.md`)
_No development work begins before Phase 0 exit criteria are met._

---

## Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Secure Platform Substrate
**Goals**: Stand up hardened infrastructure, baseline services, and non-negotiable security/observability controls in code.

### Workstreams
1. **Infrastructure & Networking**
   - Apply Terraform modules for VPC, subnets, security groups, Postgres (Aurora or RDS), Redis (Elasticache), and Kafka (MSK/Confluent Cloud) with private endpoints only.
   - Configure service mesh (Istio/Linkerd) for mutual TLS and traffic policy enforcement; integrate with cert-manager for rotation.
2. **Service Skeleton**
   - Initialize monorepo with PNPM workspaces: `apps/api`, `apps/web`, `apps/agent`, `packages/core`, `packages/errors`.
   - Implement Fastify backend scaffold with RFC 9457 error middleware and OpenAPI 3.1 spec generator.
   - Provide health endpoints with dependency checks (Postgres, Redis, Kafka, Vault, OTel Collector) returning standardized problem details on failure.
3. **Observability & Logging**
   - Embed OpenTelemetry SDK (Node auto-instrumentation) in API and agent processes; configure OTLP exporter to collector deployed via Helm.
   - Example collector config snippet:
     ```yaml
     exporters:
       otlphttp:
         endpoint: https://otel-gateway.internal:4318
         tls:
           ca_file: /etc/certs/rootCA.pem
     service:
       pipelines:
         traces:
           receivers: [otlp]
           processors: [batch, resource]
           exporters: [otlphttp]
     ```
4. **CI/CD Enforcement**
   - Implement GitHub Actions workflow `ci.yml` running lint/test/build, `security.yml` running CodeQL/Semgrep/Trivy/ggshield, and `supply-chain.yml` generating CycloneDX SBOM + SLSA provenance via `slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator`.
   - Fail merges on any high severity vulnerability.
5. **Baseline Policies**
   - Deploy Open Policy Agent sidecar for API authorization; author rego policies for role-based access and rate limiting.

## Risk Mitigation Strategies
- **AI Misbehavior**: Layered guardrails + evaluation gating, real-time anomaly detection on model outputs, human-in-the-loop override.
- **Supply Chain Attacks**: Sigstore signing, SLSA provenance, dependency pinning, periodic `npm audit --production` with allowlist governance.
- **Data Breach**: Zero-trust networking, RLS in Postgres, Kafka ACLs, encryption at rest (KMS) and in transit (mTLS), periodic penetration tests.
- **Agent Coordination Failures**: Deterministic orchestration, saga compensations, state replay validation, targeted chaos engineering.
- **Regulatory Drift**: Quarterly compliance reviews, automated control evidence capture, update backlog for new regulations.

## Monitoring & Alerting Approach
- **Metrics**: Prometheus + Grafana dashboards for latency, throughput, error rates, queue depth, cost.
- **Tracing**: OpenTelemetry spans correlated with logs for Planner→Coder→Critic, enabling root cause < 15 minutes.
- **Logging**: Structured JSON logs shipped to Loki/Elastic with PII scrubbing; audit logs stored in immutable S3 bucket with Object Lock.
- **Alerting**: Multi-channel notifications (PagerDuty, Slack). Severity mapping aligned with ITIL incident response.

## Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity
- **Multi-region deployment** with active/standby Postgres via logical replication, Redis cluster with cross-region replication, Kafka MirrorMaker 2.
- **Backups**: Nightly full + 15-minute incremental snapshots; automated verification job restores to isolated environment.
- **Runbooks**: Documented failover/rollback procedures with decision matrix; tabletop exercises each quarter.

## Continuous Improvement Loop
- Monthly retrospectives feeding into roadmap adjustments.
- Post-incident reviews stored in knowledge base and linked to Planner heuristics.
- KPI reviews (SLOs, evaluation metrics, cost) drive backlog prioritization.

This plan embeds enterprise security, compliance, and reliability controls from day zero while enabling rapid, auditable delivery of the autonomous multi-agent coding platform.
