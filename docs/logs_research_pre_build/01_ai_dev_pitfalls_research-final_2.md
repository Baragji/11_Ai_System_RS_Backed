# Complete AI Coding Limitations & Solutions Atlas (September 2025)

## Research Objective
Create a comprehensive inventory of ALL current AI coding limitations and map existing solutions to build the world's most capable autonomous AI coding system. This research will determine exactly what needs to be solved before building the autonomous system specified in spec.md.

## Research Parameters
- **Timeline**: June 2025 - September 2025 only
- **Target Models**: GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.1, GitHub Copilot Agent, Cursor Composer, v0.dev, Replit Agent V3 (September 2025), **Gemini CLI**
- **Goal**: Complete gap analysis → solution mapping → integration roadmap → development priorities

## 0. Evidence Rules (June–Sept 2025 Only)
- **Time window**: Include sources **published 2025-06-01 through 2025-09-30**; exclude older content
- **Two-source rule** for any major claim (one must be primary source: vendor docs/blogs, standards sites, regulatory sites)
- **Standards preference**: Use official standards pages for ASVS v5.0 (30 May 2025), LLM Top-10 2025, SLSA v1.0, ISO/IEC 42001, EU AI Act GPAI guidance (applicability from 2 Aug 2025) ([owasp.org][4])
- **Cost/limits realism**: Document usage throttles, premium-request pricing, repo/runner constraints for all tools
- **Pass/fail thresholds**: Define quantitative success criteria for every metric collected

## Single Session Research Execution
**Critical**: This entire research must be completed in ONE session. AI is stateless - no data carries over between sessions.
