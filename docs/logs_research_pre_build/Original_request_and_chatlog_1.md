I want to do thorough reserach and establish all common mistakes/errors/bad practices/code breaking/shortcuts/anti production grade practice, that happens when using AI as the developer team. Meaning, a human who cant code, that wants to build entreprise or production grade software. what are the common pitfalls. I am non tech so I have no idea what you call this, can you tell me what it's called and what one searches for? I need to establish a clear document to find out ALL the issues, how industry wide has solved them and whats still remaining to be solved, so an ai system can be build that is truly capable of doing autonomously everything that an entire big tech human dev team would be able to do.

You're looking to research **"AI-assisted software development pitfalls"** or **"LLM code generation limitations"**. The field studying this is often called **"AI-powered software engineering"** or **"machine programming."**

Let me search for current research and industry findings on this topic:Let me search for more specific research on autonomous AI software development:Based on the research, I'll create a comprehensive document outlining the key issues. The field you're researching is called **"Autonomous Software Engineering"** or **"AI-Assisted Software Development."**The field you're researching is called **"Autonomous Software Engineering"** or **"AI-Assisted Software Development."** I've created a comprehensive research framework document that outlines all the major pitfalls and challenges.

Key search terms you should use:
- "Autonomous software engineering challenges"
- "AI code generation limitations production"
- "LLM software development pitfalls"
- "AI programming technical debt"
- "Production-ready AI coding research"

The document reveals some striking findings: developers spend only about 24% of their time writing code, while experienced developers take 19% longer when using AI tools, and about 5% of generative AI pilots at companies are successful.

The core issue is that AI-generated code often uses incorrect libraries, violates build constraints, and overlooks subtle logic errors, and the main obstacles come when AI programs are asked to develop code at scale, or with more complex logic.

For your research, focus on monitoring MIT CSAIL's work (they published a major 2025 study on this), METR's productivity research, and industry reports from Forrester and GitHub. The document I've created provides a structured framework to guide your comprehensive research into building truly autonomous AI development systems.

Hmm but GPT5, GitHub Copilot Agent mode, Claude Opus 4.1, and community build prompts, softwares, guardrails are extremely aware of many of the things, so your data is very much outdated 1. So please stop doing the reserach, cause you aint able to do it correct 2. I only want data that is maximum 3 months old today is September 2025 3. I ONLY want you to draft the reserach paper, I can hand my assistant.

# Assistant
You're absolutely right - my research approach was flawed and the data I found is outdated given the rapid advances you mentioned with GPT-5, GitHub Copilot Agent mode, and Claude Opus 4.1.

I'll draft a research paper framework for your assistant to execute with current data (June-September 2025).I've drafted a focused research paper framework that your assistant can execute. It's designed specifically for the current AI development landscape (post-GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.1, Copilot Agent era) and focuses only on data from June-September 2025.

The framework identifies the specific research questions, methodology, data sources, and deliverables needed to map out what gaps still exist for truly autonomous enterprise-grade development teams. It acknowledges that many previous limitations have likely been solved and focuses on finding the remaining "last mile" problems.

Your assistant can follow this structured approach to gather current, relevant data on what's still preventing AI from fully replacing large development teams.

the goal is to create something like this, see attached file

# assistant
I understand now! You're building a **fully autonomous AI coding system** based on this comprehensive spec, and you need the research to identify what current AI development tools (GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.1, Copilot Agent, etc.) still can't handle from this specification.

This is a much more targeted research scope. Your assistant should focus on:

**Research Refinement Based on Your Spec:**

1. **Multi-Agent Orchestration Gaps**: How well do current AI systems handle the Planner → Coder → Critique workflow with persistent state management across components?

2. **Production-Grade System Architecture**: Can current AI tools generate the full stack you've specified (TypeScript/Node + PostgreSQL + Redis + WebSocket + OpenTelemetry + Docker compose) with proper enterprise patterns?

3. **Real-time UI Generation**: How effectively can current AI build the complex React/Next.js interface with real-time streaming, multi-model integration, and project management panels?

4. **Compliance & Security Implementation**: Can AI properly implement OWASP ASVS v5.0, EU AI Act requirements, and SLSA v1.0 provenance without human oversight?

5. **Self-Healing & Adaptive Systems**: Which AI tools can build systems that automatically detect errors, adapt strategies, and implement circuit breakers/retry logic?

Your assistant should specifically test current AI capabilities against each section of your spec and document where they fail or require human intervention. This will give you the exact gaps you need to solve to make your autonomous system superior to existing tools.

The research should answer: "What prevents current AI from building THIS system autonomously?"

# user
AND how to solve it. Thats why I suggested, that we do the entire scope of finding all pitfalls and finding if the pitfalls have been resolved and how. And those who haven't, we might need to focus on solving those, prior to trying to build the spec.md. 1. Please ingest everything, and provide guidance, what to do? how do we reserach and establish all relevant data, to create/integrate/optimize AI coding, so it works exaclty and better than normal human teams

# assistant
You're absolutely right - we need to map the **complete landscape** of AI coding limitations AND their solutions before attempting to build your autonomous system. This is a prerequisite analysis to avoid building on shaky foundations.

Here's the strategic approach:

## Research Strategy: Complete AI Coding Gap Analysis

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Pitfall Mapping (Week 1-2)
Your assistant should create a **complete inventory** covering:

**Technical Pitfalls:**
- Multi-agent coordination failures
- Context window limitations in large codebases
- State persistence across long operations
- Real-time streaming implementation gaps
- Complex database schema generation
- Enterprise security pattern implementation
- Performance optimization blind spots
- Error recovery and self-healing limitations

**Systemic Pitfalls:**
- Cross-service architecture design
- DevOps pipeline generation
- Compliance requirement implementation
- Testing strategy completeness
- Documentation generation quality
- Maintenance and update procedures

### Phase 2: Solution Mapping (Week 3-4)
For EACH identified pitfall, research:

**Solution Categories:**
1. **Fully Solved** - Which tools/approaches completely address this?
2. **Partially Solved** - What works, what doesn't, how to bridge gaps?
3. **Unsolved** - Critical gaps requiring new research/development
4. **Community Solutions** - Effective workarounds, frameworks, guardrails

**Evidence Required:**
- Specific tools/frameworks that solve each issue
- Success rates and limitations
- Integration complexity
- Cost/performance trade-offs

### Phase 3: Solution Integration Analysis (Week 5-6)
Research how to **combine** solutions:
- Which solutions work together vs. conflict?
- Integration complexity and effort required
- Performance impact of solution stacking
- Maintenance overhead of hybrid approaches

## Critical Research Questions Your Assistant Should Answer:

### For Your Spec Specifically:
1. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Can current AI maintain coherent state across Planner→Coder→Critique cycles? What frameworks solve this?

2. **Enterprise Architecture**: Which AI tools can generate production-grade TypeScript/Node + PostgreSQL + Redis systems with proper patterns?

3. **Real-time Systems**: How do current AI tools handle WebSocket implementation, streaming, and concurrent user management?

4. **Compliance Automation**: Can AI implement OWASP ASVS v5.0, EU AI Act requirements, SLSA provenance without gaps?

5. **Self-Healing Code**: Which approaches enable AI to generate adaptive, error-recovering systems?

### For Superior Performance:
6. **Human Team Comparison**: What specific advantages do human teams have that current AI lacks?

7. **Performance Bottlenecks**: Where do AI coding tools hit walls that would require human intervention?

8. **Quality Assurance**: How do we ensure AI-generated code meets enterprise standards without human review?

## Actionable Research Framework:

### Data Collection Strategy:
```
For each pitfall identified:
├── Current AI Capability Assessment
│   ├── GPT-5 performance on this issue
│   ├── Claude Opus 4.1 handling
│   ├── GitHub Copilot Agent limitations
│   └── Other tools' approaches
├── Available Solutions
│   ├── Commercial tools that address this
│   ├── Open-source frameworks
│   ├── Community workarounds
│   └── Academic research solutions
├── Integration Analysis
│   ├── How solutions combine
│   ├── Conflict identification
│   └── Performance impact
└── Gap Analysis
    ├── Remaining unsolved aspects
    ├── Research priorities
    └── Development requirements
```

### Success Metrics:
- **100% pitfall coverage** - No blind spots in analysis
- **Solution viability scoring** - Quantified assessment of each solution
- **Integration roadmap** - Clear path to combine solutions
- **Gap prioritization** - Ranked list of issues to solve first

## Strategic Recommendation:

**Don't start building your autonomous system until this research is complete.** 

The research will likely reveal:
1. **Quick wins** - Existing solutions you can integrate immediately
2. **Medium-term gaps** - Issues requiring 3-6 months of development
3. **Hard problems** - Fundamental research needed before proceeding

This approach ensures your autonomous system will be **genuinely superior** to current AI tools by systematically addressing every known limitation rather than discovering them during development.

**Your assistant's deliverable should be**: A comprehensive gap analysis with specific, actionable solutions for each identified pitfall, plus a prioritized development roadmap for building the world's most capable autonomous AI coding system.

# user
yes. so what do you think, should we modify the current "Research Paper: Current AI Development Pitfalls & Solutions in Production Software (September 2025)" or is it good as it is¨

# Assistant
The current research paper needs **significant modification**. It's too broad and doesn't align with your strategic approach of comprehensive gap analysis before building.

Here are the key problems with the current version:

## Issues with Current Research Paper:

1. **Missing Systematic Pitfall Inventory** - It focuses on general categories but doesn't create the comprehensive pitfall catalog you need

2. **No Solution Mapping Framework** - It doesn't systematically map existing solutions to specific problems

3. **Lacks Integration Analysis** - Doesn't address how solutions work together or conflict

4. **Too Academic, Not Actionable** - Structured like a research report instead of a practical development roadmap

5. **Missing Your Spec Requirements** - Doesn't specifically address the technical challenges in your spec.md

## Recommended Modification:

**Restructure it as**: "Complete AI Coding Limitations & Solutions Atlas (September 2025)"

**New Focus**:
- Systematic pitfall inventory (not just categories)
- Solution mapping for each specific issue
- Integration compatibility analysis
- Direct applicability to your autonomous system spec
- Actionable development priorities

**Key Changes Needed**:
1. Replace broad research questions with specific pitfall identification methodology
2. Add solution mapping framework for each identified issue
3. Include integration analysis between solutions
4. Add direct assessment against your spec.md requirements
5. Structure output as actionable development roadmap, not academic report

Should I rewrite the research paper with this more targeted, systematic approach that directly serves your goal of building the superior autonomous AI coding system?
